## 1. Cost Tracking & Rate-Limit Awareness

### Budget Tracking
- `daily_spend` table tracks costs per bucket per day
- **Extraction buckets:** `extract`, `quality` — LLM costs for Haiku/Sonnet extraction, evolution, narratives
- **Proxy buckets:** `proxy_input`, `proxy_output`, `proxy_cache_read`, `proxy_cache_write` — token counts from Claude Code sessions (fire-and-forget RPC after each API response)
- Separation allows independent cost analysis: what YesMem's automation costs vs. what the user's sessions consume
- `yesmem cost` — CLI shows daily spend history with totals
- **Persistent** — survives daemon restarts (restored from DB)
- **Per-bucket limits:**
  - `daily_budget_extract_usd: 5.0` (extraction + evolution)
  - `daily_budget_quality_usd: 2.0` (narrative + quality)
- 80% warning logged when approaching limit

### Rate-Limit Awareness

Built-in backoff to share API quota with Claude Code sessions:

| Level | Delay | On Rate Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Between sessions | yield (`runtime.Gosched`) | 30s backoff |
| Between chunks | 2s | 60s backoff |
| Evolution checks | 5s | 60s backoff |

### Rate-Limit Header Tracking (v1.0.1)

The proxy parses Anthropic rate-limit headers from every API response:
- **`ParseRateLimitHeaders`** extracts `anthropic-ratelimit-requests-*` and `anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-*` headers into a `RateLimitInfo` struct
- **`ShouldThrottle`** with fallback chain: header-based utilization → estimated utilization → conservative default
- **Extraction throttle:** When API utilization exceeds 50%, the extraction pipeline pauses to preserve quota for interactive sessions
- **`_track_usage` RPC** accepts `cache_read`, `cache_write`, and rate-limit fields alongside standard token counts
- **Schema v0.52:** `token_usage` table has `cache_read` and `cache_write` columns for granular cache hit/miss tracking

## 2. LoCoMo Benchmark (E5a)

Reproducible benchmark against the LoCoMo dataset (Long Conversation Memory) — the de-facto standard for memory system evaluation.

### Pipeline

```
locomo10.json → Ingest → Extract → Query → Judge → Report
```

| Stage | What | Tool |
|-------|------|------|
| **Ingest** | 10 conversations → YesMem sessions (Speaker A=User, B=Assistant, original timestamps) | `yesmem locomo-bench ingest` |
| **Extract** | Standard 4-pass extraction pipeline per conversation | `yesmem locomo-bench extract` |
| **Query** | `hybrid_search` per question, Top-K learnings as context → LLM answers | `yesmem locomo-bench query` |
| **Judge** | LLM judge scores Generated vs. Gold answer | `yesmem locomo-bench judge` |
| **Report** | Aggregate per category + overall mean (categories 1-4, adversarial excluded) | `yesmem locomo-bench report` |

### QA Categories

| Category | ID | What it measures |
|----------|----|------------------|
| Single-hop | 1 | Direct fact retrieval |
| Multi-hop | 2 | Reasoning across multiple facts |
| Temporal | 3 | Time-based questions |
| Open-domain | 4 | World knowledge + memory combined |
| Adversarial | 5 | **NOT scored** — trick questions |

### Key Results

- **Score progression:** 0.13 → 0.62 through 5 optimizations (embedding fix, anticipated queries 3→5, BM25 optimizations, tiered search, dataset correction)
- **anticipated_queries as separate vectors** was the breakthrough: multi-hop jumped from 0.11 to 0.62
- Own extraction (0.47) beats gold observations (0.41) because gold has no aq-vectors
- Agentic mode (LLM uses YesMem tools directly): 0.69 on 10% sample
- **Tool rotation in agentic mode:** Rounds 0–2 force specific search tools (hybrid → deep → keyword) to ensure coverage before letting the model choose freely

### CLI

```bash
yesmem locomo-bench --data ./locomo10.json --eval-llm gpt-5.4-mini
yesmem locomo-bench ingest --data ./locomo10.json    # step-by-step
yesmem locomo-bench run --eval-llm sonnet             # full pipeline
```

Note: Individual subcommands (`extract`, `query`, `judge`, `report`) are recognized but not yet wired — use `run` for the full pipeline.

### Variants

| Variant | What | Shows |
|---------|------|-------|
| A: Learnings only | Extraction → hybrid_search → answer | Learning quality |
| B: Learnings + Raw Messages | hybrid_search + FTS5 on messages | Two-layer advantage |
| C: Full-Context Baseline | Entire conversation → LLM directly | Baseline without memory |
| D: Proxy + Compression | Conversation through proxy → QA | Compression preserves quality? |

## 3. Sync-Public Script

The `scripts/sync-public.sh` script synchronizes the private repository to the public GitHub mirror. Recent additions:
- **`--branch` flag**: sync a specific branch instead of main
- **Whitelist mode**: only copies files explicitly listed — prevents accidental leak of private content
- **`--per-commit` mode**: replays commits individually instead of squashing into one
- **Auto-CHANGELOG generation**: generates CHANGELOG entries from git log automatically

## 4. Auto-Update

Self-updating binary distribution via GitHub Releases — no Git required on target systems.

### Update Pipeline

1. **Check** — `GET /repos/carsteneu/yesmem/releases/latest`, semver comparison with `buildinfo.Version`
2. **Download** — platform-specific archive (`yesmem_{os}_{arch}.tar.gz`) with SHA256 checksum verification against `checksums.txt`
3. **Replace** — atomic swap: write to temp file → `os.Rename` to target path. Old binary preserved as `.bak`
4. **Migrate** — `yesmem migrate` runs DB schema migration, directory creation, config merge (new defaults without overwriting user values), hook updates
5. **Restart** — `yesmem restart` restarts daemon + proxy with the new binary

### Safety

- **SHA256 checksum verification** — archive validated before extraction
- **io.LimitReader** (100 MB) — prevents memory exhaustion from malicious payloads
- **Extraction guard** — daemon skips update while extraction or indexing is running (atomic `extractionActive` flag)
- **Atomic binary swap** — temp file + rename, never partial writes to live binary
- **Backup** — old binary always preserved as `yesmem.bak` for manual rollback
- **exec timeouts** — migrate and restart commands have 20s timeout via `context.WithTimeout`
- **Non-semver handling** — commit hashes (e.g. `7ba6267`) always trigger update offer

### Daemon Integration

- Periodic ticker (configurable via `update.check_interval`, default `6h`)
- Respects `update.auto_update` config flag (default: `true`)
- Skips check when extraction or indexing is active
- Logs all update activity: check, download, install, restart

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `check-update` | Check if a newer version is available on GitHub Releases |
| `update` | Download, verify, install, migrate, and restart |
| `migrate` | Post-update migration: DB schema, directories, config merge, hooks |

### Configuration

```yaml
update:
  auto_update: true        # periodic daemon checks (default: true)
  check_interval: "6h"     # how often to check (default: 6h)
  channel: "stable"        # release channel (future: beta)
```

## 5. Capabilities System (Cap-Spec v1.1)

YesMem capabilities are reusable, tested tool definitions persisted in `caps.db` and rendered as Markdown bundles (`CAP.md`). The cap system answers a recurring need: "I built this useful tool inside one Claude session and want to call it from any future session, from a scheduled job, or from the proxy mid-fork."

### Cap Anatomy

A `CAP.md` file declares one or more **scripts**, each with a runtime and a kind:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `kind: tool` | Registers as a callable tool inside the Claude REPL via `registerTool()` |
| `kind: handler` | Server-side handler invoked by another script or by the scheduler |
| `runtime: repl` | Body is JavaScript executed in the Claude Code REPL VM (sealed allowlist, no `import`/`require`) |
| `runtime: bash` | Body is a Bash script executed by the daemon (with optional sandbox profile) |
| `sandbox: none/standard/strict` | Per-script override of the job-level sandbox profile; `none` is rejected on `scope: project` caps |
| `databaseSQL` | DDL block describing tables this cap maintains via `cap_store` |

### Lifecycle

1. **Author** — write `CAP.md` (typically via the `yesmem-cap-builder` bundled skill, which ships the spec, recipes, an API reference, and 28 documented gotchas).
2. **Save** — call `save_cap` (MCP). The daemon parses the file via `internal/capfile`, validates scripts/runtimes/sandbox values, hydrates `databaseSQL` via `GetCapTableDDL`, and writes a row to `caps.db` with an auto-incrementing version.
3. **Activate** — `activate_cap` returns `registerTool()` JS the REPL evaluates. From then on, the cap appears as a native MCP-style tool in that thread; subsequent threads re-inject it automatically.
4. **Run** — either interactively (REPL invokes the registered tool) or via the scheduler (`mode=bash`, `cap_name=…`, `script_name=…`).
5. **Auto-correct** — failed bash runs are diff-classified by Sonnet and either auto-applied via `save_cap` or surfaced as `cap_proposed` rows for user review (see §20 Bash Mode + Auto-Correct).

### Bundled Caps

`caps/bundled-caps/<name>/CAP.md` is embedded into the binary. On install/migrate, the bundled body is written to `~/.claude/caps/<name>/CAP.md` via `InstallBundledCaps` (sha256 content-compare; **no version-compare** — embed wins over disk on any byte difference). A separate write-back path, `WriteCapToDisk`, exports DB rows to disk and **does** respect version: it skips when `disk_version >= db_version` (T1 version-guard, commit `4d28e34`).

The two paths together mean: after editing a bundled cap, run `make deploy` first (rebuilds the binary embedding the new source), then `yesmem migrate`. Reversing the order risks a v62-Source-Edit + v58-Embed downgrade because the InstallBundledCaps content-compare wins on any byte difference.

### Storage

`caps.db` holds:

- `caps` — name, version, body, scope (`global` | `project:<name>`), updated_at
- `cap_<name>__<table>` — per-cap user-defined tables created on demand via `cap_store(action="create_table"|"upsert"|"query"|"delete"|"list_tables")`
- `learnings` rows tagged `category="cap_proposed"` carry the auto-correct queue; `cap_proposal_decide` accepts or rejects each proposal

Full schema in `yesdocs/architecture/db-schema.md`.

### Bash Polyfills for Caps

Cap scripts declared with `runtime: bash` execute in the daemon's sandboxed environment — they don't have access to the Claude Code REPL or MCP tools. YesMem provides two polyfill functions that bridge this gap via Unix socket RPC to the daemon:

**`store()` — Key-Value Persistence**

```bash
store mykey "my value"
```

Writes a key-value pair directly to `caps.db` via the `cap_store` RPC. No round-trip through the MCP server needed. Used by cap handlers that need to persist state between invocations (e.g. Telegram last-read-message cursor, RSS last-fetch timestamp).

**`llm()` — LLM Completion**

```bash
result=$(llm "summarize this text: $long_text" --model haiku --max-tokens 500)
```

Calls the daemon's `llm_complete` RPC with the configured quality model. Supports:
- `--model <tier>` — `haiku`, `sonnet`, or `opus` (resolved per provider)
- `--max-tokens <N>` — output token limit
- Session-resume — subsequent calls in the same bash job reuse the prompt cache
- Provider-aware — works with Anthropic, DeepSeek, and OpenAI providers via the standard LLM provider routing

Both polyfills are defined in `internal/daemon/handler_cap_exec.go` and injected into the AI-jail environment via the bun wrapper. They make bash caps functionally equivalent to REPL caps — the same scripts work identically under Claude Code (REPL VM), opencode (bun MCP wrapper), and the CLI (direct daemon execution).

Cap-Spec v1.1 lives in the sibling project `~/projects/cap-spec`. The `yesmem-cap-builder` bundled skill (336-line `SKILL.md` + recipes, api-reference, gotchas side-files) is the canonical reference for landing a working cap in one pass — it covers the REPL VM allowlist, the `sh` 30 KB wall, `sanitize_where`, schema rules, the bundled-cap DB write-back lifecycle (including pre-commit version sync), and the jq label/apostrophe quirks.

---

## 6. Secret Sanitization

`SecretRedactor` (`internal/sanitize`) is a single-pass regex-based redactor that replaces matches with `[redacted:<kind>]` markers. It runs at every persistence boundary so a leaked credential never reaches durable storage — neither in summaries, scheduled-job logs, briefings, nor extraction results.

### Pattern Kinds (15)

| Kind | What it catches |
|------|------------------|
| `anthropic_api_key` | `sk-ant-…` keys |
| `openai_api_key` | OpenAI `sk-…` and project keys |
| `aws_access_key_id` / `aws_secret_access_key` | Long-lived AWS credentials |
| `github_pat` | Classic and fine-grained GitHub PATs |
| `jwt` | Three-segment Base64URL JWTs |
| `bearer_token` | `Authorization: Bearer …` and other Bearer-prefixed strings (broadened beyond the Authorization header in commit `0e0cb94`) |
| `password_in_url` | `proto://user:pass@host` URLs |
| `generic_api_key` | High-entropy `KEY=…` / `TOKEN=…` env-style strings; charset includes `./+=` for base64-shaped tokens (`2e819a2`) |
| `ssh_private_key_block` / `gpg_private_key_block` | Multi-line key blocks |
| `ipv4_public` | IPv4 addresses outside RFC1918 ranges |
| `hex_secret` | Long uppercase/lowercase hex strings |
| `email` / `phone` | Personal identifiers; phone regex tightened to reject IPv4-like dotted strings (`7d7e1a6`) |

### Decorator Chain

`SanitizingClient` wraps any `LLMClient`:

- **Sanitize-before** — outbound prompts pass through the redactor before hitting the upstream API.
- **Sanitize-after** — inbound responses pass through again so model-echo of unredacted prompts cannot recontaminate logs.
- **Inner-error path** — even when the wrapped client fails, the partial response is sanitized before the error bubbles up.

The decorator wraps **all six** LLM call sites in the daemon: extraction, briefing, summarize, quickstart, quality, and the headless+briefing fallback. Wiring is done at assignment time rather than post-replacement to avoid a window where an unwrapped client could be reused.

The scheduler also redacts `Command`, `ErrorMsg`, headless stdout, and stderr (`cf66345`) before persisting to `bash_job_runs`.

### Allowed Exceptions

`AllowedExceptions` in `config.yaml` lists strings that bypass redaction. Match is **full-match** (anchored both ends), not substring, so `MY_PUBLIC_TOKEN` does not unmask `MY_PUBLIC_TOKEN_FOR_TEST`. The decorator-order contract (sanitize wraps client, never the other way around) is documented in `internal/extraction/SANITIZING_CLIENT.md`.

### Configuration

```yaml
sanitization:
  enabled: true
  allowed_exceptions:
    - "TEST_FIXTURE_KEY"
    - "EXAMPLE_BEARER_PUBLIC_DEMO"
```

When `enabled: false` (default in dev), the wrapper is a no-op pass-through; production deployments should enable it. Defense-in-depth rollout status is tracked in `yesdocs/plans/2026-04-30-defense-in-depth-rollout-roadmap.md`.

---

## 7. Sandbox Execution

Bash-mode scheduled jobs and headless agent invocations that opt in run inside `ai-jail`, a network-restricted, filesystem-restricted Linux sandbox. The daemon resolves the sandbox profile per fire and wraps the command via `BuildSandboxedCommand` (bash) / `WrapExecArgs` (headless) before invoking `exec.Cmd`.

### Profiles

| Profile | Network | Filesystem | Use case |
|---------|---------|------------|----------|
| `none` | Unrestricted | Unrestricted | Dev / trusted local caps. **Rejected on `scope: project` caps** — project caps must declare a non-`none` sandbox to prevent untrusted cap code from wiping the worktree (`b5481cf`) |
| `standard` | Allowed ports configurable (default `80,443`) | Read-only `/`, writable `$CWD` | Default for scheduled bash jobs |
| `strict` | None | Read-only `/`, writable scratch only | Untrusted research caps, web-scraping bundles, third-party adapter caps |

Profiles are persisted in `scheduled_jobs.sandbox` (job-level) and optionally overridden per script via `Script.Sandbox` in `CAP.md` (script-level). Resolution: explicit script value > job value > daemon default. When the script-level value matches the job-level value, the override log line is suppressed (`e8bb0ff`) to keep heartbeat output quiet.

### ai-jail Integration

The daemon:

1. Resolves the `ai-jail` binary path on startup (downloaded from a pinned GitHub release, extracted from the tarball).
2. Wraps `exec.Cmd` via `BuildSandboxedCommand` for bash-mode jobs and `WrapExecArgs` for `executeHeadless`.
3. Fails closed when the sandbox is unavailable — auto-correct will not silently re-fire an unsandboxed command on systems where the binary is missing.

`.ai-jail` sandbox configs are git-ignored so per-machine tweaks do not leak into commits.

### Caveats

- **In-memory pointer.** `fireJobBash` reads `job.Sandbox` from `s.jobs[id]`, not per-fire from the DB. A direct SQL `UPDATE scheduled_jobs SET sandbox=...` does not take effect until daemon restart or until the job is re-created via `mcp__yesmem__schedule(action="delete"|"create")`.
- **save-cap race for script-level sandbox.** When two sessions edit the same cap in parallel (e.g. `telegram` in two worktrees), `save_cap` writes overwrite each other every few minutes. Per-script `sandbox=none` declared via `save_cap` is therefore unstable across parallel sessions; use the job-level `scheduled_jobs.sandbox` (decoupled from `save_cap`) for stable overrides.
- **Auto-correct + sandbox.** When the sandbox profile is unavailable, auto-correct refuses to apply a fix; this is intentional fail-closed, not a bug.

## Differentiators

What makes YesMem fundamentally different — not "also does X", but "nobody else can do X":

### The Moat: Wire-Level Control

1. **Invisible Memory** — YesMem sits between Claude Code and the Anthropic API as an HTTP proxy. Memory is injected, context is compressed, and sessions are managed *before the model sees anything*. The user never calls a "remember" tool — it just happens. No other memory system operates at the wire level.
2. **Infinite Thread** — Conversations don't hit context limits. The proxy progressively compresses old messages through 4 decay stages (full → summary → stub → collapsed), with sawtooth cache management that recovers context on demand. Other systems tell you to start a new chat.
3. **Real-Time Background Extraction** — A forked agent pipeline extracts learnings *while the session is still running*, not after it ends. By the time you finish a debugging session, the insights are already indexed and searchable.
4. **Associative Priming** — Every user message triggers automatic semantic search. Relevant memories are injected into the next model response — invisibly, at the proxy layer. The model gets context it didn't ask for, and the user gets answers informed by past sessions without doing anything.

### Things Nobody Else Has

5. **Source Attribution** — Every learning tracks its origin: `user_stated > agreed_upon > claude_suggested > llm_extracted`. We analyzed 31 memory-related research papers. None of them track provenance. This means YesMem can distinguish "the user told me this" from "I inferred this" — and weight them differently.
6. **Fixation Detection** — When the model gets stuck in a loop (same error, same fix attempt, same failure), YesMem detects it automatically and penalizes the scoring of the learnings that caused the loop. Other systems let you spiral; YesMem breaks the cycle.
7. **Gotcha Prevention** — The hook system intercepts tool calls *before execution*. Failed commands are auto-learned; on the next attempt, relevant gotchas are injected as warnings so the model can course-correct. After 3+ repeated failures of the same pattern, the command is hard-blocked — the model can't make the same mistake a fourth time. Prevention escalates: context first, then a wall.
8. **Multi-Agent Memory Safety** — Multiple Claude Code agents share long-term memory with conflict detection, dialog-extract-block protocol, agent-role scoping, and auto-broadcast. This isn't "shared database" — it's coordinated memory with write isolation.
9. **Emotional Memory** — Sessions are rated by intensity (breakthroughs, frustration, pivots). Learnings from high-intensity sessions score higher in retrieval. The system remembers *what mattered*, not just what happened.

### Architectural Advantages

10. **Zero-Dependency Binary** — Single Go binary, ~30MB, with a 512-dimensional embedding model compiled in via `go:embed`. No Python, no pip, no Docker, no external services. `curl | sh` and you're running.
11. **Two-Layer Architecture** — Raw material (full session transcripts, indexed documents) is preserved for deep search. Distilled learnings provide fast access. You get both precision and recall — grep through old conversations *or* get instant structured answers.
12. **Trust-Based Evolution** — Learnings have trust levels. A `user_stated` fact resists being overwritten by an `llm_extracted` inference. High-trust knowledge requires high-trust evidence to supersede. This prevents hallucination-driven memory corruption.
13. **Ebbinghaus Decay** — Memory fading follows spaced-repetition curves grounded in cognitive science, not arbitrary TTLs. Frequently accessed learnings stay fresh; unused ones fade predictably. Decisions and pivot moments decay slower than routine observations.
14. **Orthogonal Scoring** — Five independent counters (use, citation, retrieval, injection, feedback) prevent a learning from becoming "important" just because it was retrieved often. A learning that gets injected 50 times but never cited is noise, not signal.
15. **Persona Continuity** — Not just fact storage — a persistent identity model that evolves across sessions. Traits, preferences, communication style, expertise areas. Session 1036 knows who you are because sessions 1–1035 built that understanding incrementally.

### Project Exclusion

- **`exclude_projects`:** Projects can be excluded from session indexing and extraction by adding them to `exclude_projects: []` in config.yaml. Applies to both the indexer and the opencode scanner. Useful for build directories, temporary projects, or noise-heavy repositories.


## 8. Scheduled Agents

Cron-based task scheduler built into the daemon. Define recurring or one-shot jobs that spawn agents automatically.

### Three Execution Modes

| Mode | How | Visibility | Overhead | Use case |
|------|-----|-----------|----------|----------|
| `agent` | Spawns PTY bridge + tmux window | Visible | Full briefing + agent lifecycle | Complex tasks, debugging, coding plans |
| `headless` | Runs `claude -p` as subprocess | Silent | Minimal — no lifecycle management | Routine automation, cron jobs, data collection |
| `bash` | Executes a cap's `runtime: bash` script directly in the daemon | Silent | Smallest — no LLM call, no agent process | High-frequency polling (Telegram, RSS, health probes), deterministic shell pipelines, anything where a single shell script is the right primitive |

### MCP Interface

Single `schedule` tool with four actions:

```
schedule(action="create", name="daily-reddit", cron="0 9 * * *", prompt="...", mode="headless")
schedule(action="list")
schedule(action="delete", id="sched-daily-reddit-12345")
schedule(action="run", id="sched-daily-reddit-12345")   # manual trigger
```

### Task Delivery

The scheduler writes the task prompt to a job-specific scratchpad section **before** spawning the agent. The agent reads its task from the briefing — no relay timing issues.

```
Scratchpad section: sched-<job-name>
Content: ## SCHEDULED TASK [<job-name>]
         Job-ID: <id>
         <wrapped prompt with focus instructions>
```

### Agent Lifecycle

- **Pre-spawn cleanup** — stops any existing agent on the same section
- **Idle timeout** — 10-minute unified timeout across all agent states (running, frozen, idle)
- **Watchdog goroutine** — polls agent status every 30 seconds, stops idle agents

### Headless Mode

Uses `claude -p` (Claude Code non-interactive mode) as a daemon subprocess:
- Full MCP tool access (caps, cap_store, haiku, scratchpad)
- Runs through the proxy (subscription-based, no API key needed)
- Output captured and written to scratchpad
- No tmux window, no PTY bridge, no watchdog needed

### Caps as Automation Primitives

Caps are ideal for scheduled tasks because they are predictable: defined schema, known handler, deterministic behavior. The agent activates the cap and executes it — no improvisation needed.

### Bash Mode + Auto-Correct

Bash-mode jobs execute a single named script from a capability's `CAP.md` (`runtime: bash`). The scheduler resolves the script via `findBashScript(meta, job.ScriptName)` — explicit `script_name` is mandatory whenever a cap declares multiple bash scripts, otherwise the first declared script wins silently and the job appears to "succeed" while running the wrong code.

A heartbeat-driven error handler (1 s tick, down from 2 s) processes failed runs in the background:

1. **Diff classifier** — compares the cap's current body against a Sonnet-suggested fix and labels the diff as *trivial* (1-2 line typo, regex tweak) or *substantial* (logic change, new branch, removed assertion).
2. **Trivial path** — auto-applies the fix via `save_cap` and re-fires the job.
3. **Substantial path** — writes the proposal as a `learnings.cap_proposed` row; user reviews and accepts/rejects via the `cap_proposal_decide` MCP tool.
4. **Rate-limits** — T4 caps the per-cap auto-correct retry budget; T5 blocks runaway re-fires when the same script fails N times in a row.
5. **Sandbox-aware** — fails closed when the configured sandbox profile is unavailable instead of silently downgrading to unsandboxed execution.

**Cap consolidation pattern:** Poll-and-reply caps (e.g. Telegram) run both polling and replying in a single Bash script via a deadline-loop: `poll(), reply(), retry if more data, exit at deadline`. This avoids spawning separate headless agents per incoming message and keeps state closures within the same AI-jail process for the full fire interval.

Each bash run is persisted in `bash_job_runs` (CRUD via `internal/storage/bash_run.go`) with stdout/stderr; both streams are routed through `SanitizingClient` when secret redaction is enabled, so credentials accidentally echoed by a script never reach the durable log.

**Caveat — in-memory `job.Sandbox`:** the scheduler reads `job.Sandbox` from its in-memory pointer (`s.jobs[id]`), so a direct `UPDATE scheduled_jobs SET sandbox=...` does not take effect until daemon restart or until the job is re-created through `mcp__yesmem__schedule(action="delete"|"create")`.

### Cap Consolidation Pattern

When a capability needs both poll-based ingestion *and* reactive replies, run them in **one** scheduled bash script with an internal deadline-loop instead of two separate schedules:

```bash
DEADLINE=$(($(date +%s) + 55))
while [ $(date +%s) -lt $DEADLINE ]; do
  REMAIN=$((DEADLINE - $(date +%s)))
  [ $REMAIN -le 4 ] && break
  # 1. long-poll for new updates (timeout bounded by REMAIN)
  # 2. store any updates locally
  # 3. only attempt expensive reply (e.g. claude -p) if REMAIN > 30
done
```

Why this matters: a separate "reply" job with `interval_seconds: 1` (or empty cron) becomes a daemon-tick spinner. The `telegram` cap was firing 60+ bash forks per minute against an idle reply queue, even though only one fire per minute (the cron-driven poll) ever touched the network. Consolidating into a single 55-second long-fire amortizes the fork cost and keeps user-facing reply latency under one cron tick. The `REMAIN > 30` guard prevents starting a new `claude -p` reply that would extend past the next fire boundary.

Verified on the `telegram` cap (poll + reply merged into the `telegram_poll` script, 2026-05-04). Reply round-trip is around 41 seconds; the `REMAIN > 30` cutoff leaves enough headroom for the next fire to start cleanly without overlap.

### Comparison with Anthropic Scheduled Tasks

| | Anthropic Cloud Routines | Desktop Scheduled Tasks | YesMem Scheduler |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runs on | Anthropic cloud | Local (app open) | Local (daemon) |
| Memory | None (fresh each run) | None | Full persistent memory |
| Local files | No (fresh clone) | Yes | Yes |
| MCP servers | Connectors only | Local | Full local MCP |
| Caps/Tools | N/A | N/A | Reusable caps + cap_store |
| Cost | API tokens + $0.08/h | Subscription | Subscription |
| Limits | Pro: 5/day, Max: 15/day | Desktop-bound | Unlimited (self-hosted) |

6. **Fixation Detection** — When the model gets stuck in a loop (same error, same fix attempt, same failure), YesMem detects it automatically and penalizes the scoring of the learnings that caused the loop. Other systems let you spiral; YesMem breaks the cycle.
7. **Gotcha Prevention** — The hook system intercepts tool calls *before execution*. Failed commands are auto-learned; on the next attempt, relevant gotchas are injected as warnings so the model can course-correct. After 3+ repeated failures of the same pattern, the command is hard-blocked — the model can't make the same mistake a fourth time. Prevention escalates: context first, then a wall.
8. **Multi-Agent Memory Safety** — Multiple Claude Code agents share long-term memory with conflict detection, dialog-extract-block protocol, agent-role scoping, and auto-broadcast. This isn't "shared database" — it's coordinated memory with write isolation.
9. **Emotional Memory** — Sessions are rated by intensity (breakthroughs, frustration, pivots). Learnings from high-intensity sessions score higher in retrieval. The system remembers *what mattered*, not just what happened.

### Architectural Advantages

10. **Zero-Dependency Binary** — Single Go binary, ~30MB, with a 512-dimensional embedding model compiled in via `go:embed`. No Python, no pip, no Docker, no external services. `curl | sh` and you're running.
11. **Two-Layer Architecture** — Raw material (full session transcripts, indexed documents) is preserved for deep search. Distilled learnings provide fast access. You get both precision and recall — grep through old conversations *or* get instant structured answers.
12. **Trust-Based Evolution** — Learnings have trust levels. A `user_stated` fact resists being overwritten by an `llm_extracted` inference. High-trust knowledge requires high-trust evidence to supersede. This prevents hallucination-driven memory corruption.
13. **Ebbinghaus Decay** — Memory fading follows spaced-repetition curves grounded in cognitive science, not arbitrary TTLs. Frequently accessed learnings stay fresh; unused ones fade predictably. Decisions and pivot moments decay slower than routine observations.
14. **Orthogonal Scoring** — Five independent counters (use, citation, retrieval, injection, feedback) prevent a learning from becoming "important" just because it was retrieved often. A learning that gets injected 50 times but never cited is noise, not signal.
15. **Persona Continuity** — Not just fact storage — a persistent identity model that evolves across sessions. Traits, preferences, communication style, expertise areas. Session 1036 knows who you are because sessions 1–1035 built that understanding incrementally.

## Deployment

```bash
cd ~/memory/yesmem
make build                      # Build with correct GOROOT/GOPATH/GOCACHE
make deploy                     # Build + deploy to ~/.local/bin/yesmem
```

After deploy: `/mcp reconnect` in Claude Code to restart MCP server.

### CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`):
- **ci.yml** — Runs on every push to `main` + PRs. Test matrix: Ubuntu + macOS. Validates build and tests on both platforms.
- **release.yml** — Runs on version tags (`v*`). Tests on Ubuntu + macOS must pass, then GoReleaser builds binaries for `linux/darwin × amd64/arm64`. Creates GitHub Release with checksums.
- Release flow: `git tag v1.0.3 && git push origin v1.0.3` → GitHub Actions builds + publishes.

**systemd:** User services with `After=network-online.target` + `Wants=network-online.target` (required for DNS after suspend/resume).

**Optimal migration/rebuild sequence:**
```bash
yesmem reextract                # re-extract all sessions
yesmem embed-learnings --all    # embed all learnings
yesmem regenerate-narratives    # regenerate narratives
yesmem bootstrap-persona --all  # re-extract persona
yesmem synthesize-persona       # re-synthesize directive
yesmem claudemd --all           # regenerate ops files
```
